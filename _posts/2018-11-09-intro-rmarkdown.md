title: "Making reproducible and dynamic documents and reports in R"
text: "R has an extremely powerful system for inserting the output of some code into a document such as a manuscript. This is called R Markdown, which uses simple special characters and commands to generate a document with output from R code, such as a figure. Learning how to write R Markdown documents can save enormous amounts of time and energy to finishing a manuscript, thesis, and so so much more! Come to this session to learn a brief introduction to creating reproducible documents with R Markdown."
