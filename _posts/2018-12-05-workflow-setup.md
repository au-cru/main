title: "Best practices in data analysis workflow and project management in R"
text: "Do you often forget which files are part of which project? Does it take some time to find all the files you need for an analysis and manuscript? In these session we will cover best practices on workflows and project management. An efficient, systematic, and standardized workflow is essential to being more reproducible and writing better code. It's also important for doing more rigorous science and being more open. Come to this session to learn how to set up and use an efficient, open, and reproducible workflow that will help you organise not only your code, but also your mind!"
