intro-pkg-functions,Creating your own functions,"Every action in R is a function, so learning what they are and how to create them is a great way to learn more about R. Plus, creating your own functions is a powerful way to become more efficient and productive in your R coding! Come to this session to learn about functions, making them, and using them.",2018-06-01,11:00,12:30,1264,310,,intermediate,R,reproducible analyses,code along
intro-rmarkdown,Making reproducible documents with R,"R has an extremely powerful system for inserting the output of some code into a document such as a manuscript. This is called R Markdown, which uses simple special characters and commands to generate a document with output from R code, such as a figure. Learning how to write R Markdown documents can save enormous amounts of time and energy to finishing a manuscript, thesis, and so so much more! Come to this session to learn a brief introduction to creating reproducible documents with R Markdown.",2018-06-15,10:00,11:30,1260,114,rmarkdown knitr,intermediate,R,reproducible analyses,code along
intro-ggplot2,Generate beautiful and insightful graphics in R,"One of the main strengths of R is it's ability to create beautiful and meaningful graphs with very little code. Come to this session to learn about the ""grammer of graphics"" with ggplot2.",2018-10-19,10:00,11:30,1264,310,tidyverse,beginner,R,introduction to R,code along
intro-data-wrangling,Work with and manage your data efficiently in R,"Analyzing, using, wrangling, and molding data are a core feature and focus of R, as it is a statistical programming language. Come learn the basics of working with and wrangling data (called data frames in R) in this session!",2018-10-26,10:00,11:30,1264,310,tidyverse,beginner,R,introduction to R,code along

intro-reproducible-workflow,Refining your analysis workflow using packages in R,"Having an efficient, systematic, and standardized workflow is essential to being more reproducible and writing better code. It's also important for doing more rigorous science and being more open. Come to this session to learn how to set up and use an efficient, open, and reproducible workflow that will help you organise not only your code, but also your mind!",,,,,,prodigenr devtools usethis,intermediate,R,reproducible analyses,code along
intro-bash,Communicate directly with your computer using the terminal,Using the terminal (also called shell or commandline) is an extremely powerful way to directly tell your computer what you want it to do and how you want it done. Learning just a few commands can greatly increase your productively and knowledge on how computers work. Come to this session to learn the basics of interacting and communicating directly with your computer through the terminal.,,,,,,,beginner,Bash,,code along
pkg-unit-testing,Test that your code is validate and accurate,Do you know for certain that your code does what you think it should do? It might not! Communicating with computers is difficult! Humans aren't very good at logic. That's where unit testing comes in! Unit testing is a way to confirm that your code produces the output you think it should.,,,,,,testthat devtools usethis,intermediate,R,package development,code along
